dtoMapper
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pokaru/dtoMapper.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pokaru/dtoMapper)

I'm sure there may be othere tools out there, but this is my quick stab at a simple framework to automate the process of mapping dto objects to other objects.

With dtoMapper, you can transer DTO field values to **multiple** objects without calling a single getter or setter.

Usage
-----
```java
...

Map<String, Object> objectMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();
objectMap.put("someKey", object1);
objectMap.put("someOtherKey", object2);

Mapper.fromDto(dto, objectMap);
Mapper.toDto(dto, objectMap);
```

Annotations
-----------
**@MappedObject(key="someKey")** (class-level)
> When you annotate your DTO with this annotation, you set which object your DTO will map to.  The **key** attribute is required and used to reference which object in a map (discussed later) your DTO will map to.
> All DTO fields, by default, will map to fields in the mapped object, referenced by the **key**.
> The mapper will assume the field names in the DTO are identical to the field names in the mapped object.

**@MappedField** (field-level)
> #### Attribute: field="someFieldName"
> In the case where fields names in the mapped object aren't the same as the field names in the DTO, you can annotate a DTO field with this annotation.  Using the **field** attribute, you can specify the field name in the mapped object that the annotated DTO field will map to.

> #### Attribute: mappedOjbectKey="someKey"
> In addition to **field**, the @MappedField annotation has another attribute, **mappedObjectKey**.  Setting this attribute is equivalent to setting the @MappedObject annotation, but at the field-level.  Using this attribute, you can map a DTO field to an object other than the one referenced by the @MappedObject class-level annotation.
> If each field in the in the DTO is annotated with this annotation and **mappedObjectKey** is set, the @MappedObject class-level annotation isn't necessary or required.


**@Ignore** (field-level)
> If you ever need to declare a field in a DTO that shouldn't be mapped, annotating that field with this annotation will have the mapper ignore that field during the mapping process.

Object Map
----------
The `String` to `Object` map, that you'll pass to the mapper is the object look-up.  The keys you specify in this map are the same keys that will be referenced by the annotations described above.

DTO's, for the most part, are flat in structure.  Business objects won't always be as flat as the DTO's that map to them.  To set values within a mapped object's nested object, put the nested object into the `objectMap` and use the annotations above to map DTO fields to that nested object's fields.

Examples
--------
**Class-Level Mapping (Simple Case)**
```java
@MappedObject(key="someKey")
public class MyDTO{
    private String someField;
}
```
**Class-Level Mapping (w/a DTO field mapped to a field by a differnt name)**
```java
@MappedObject(key="someKey")
public class MyDTO{
    @MappedField(field="anotherName")
    private String someField;
}
```
**Class-Level Mapping (w/a field mapped to a different object.)**
```java
@MappedObject(key="someKey")
public class MyDTO{
    private String someField;
    
    @MappedField(mappedObjectKey="someOtherKey")
    private String someField2;
}
```
**Class-Level Mapping (w/a field mapped to a field with a different name within a different object)**
```java
@MappedObject(key="someKey")
public class MyDTO{
    private String someField;
    
    @MappedField(mappedObjectKey="someOtherKey", field="anotherName")
    private String someField2;
}
```
**All Field-Level Mappings**
```java
public class MyDTO{
    @MappedField(mappedObjectKey="someKey")
    private String someField;
    
    @MappedField(mappedObjectKey="someOtherKey", field="anotherName")
    private String someField2;
}
```
**Ignored Field**
```java
@MappedObject(key="someKey")
public class MyDTO{
    @Ignore
    private String someField;
}
```
